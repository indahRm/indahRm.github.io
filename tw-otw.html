          <h3 id="newworkintro">Introduction</h3>

          <p>This tutorial details how to post a new work to Archive of Our Own (AO3). If you are looking to import an existing work published on a different site, visit <a href="https://archiveofourown.org/faq/tutorial-importing-text-based-works" rel="nofollow">Tutorial: Importing Text-Based Works</a>.</p>
          
          <p>To post a work onto AO3, you must be logged into an AO3 account. To learn more about registering for an AO3 account, please refer to <a href="https://archiveofourown.org/faq/your-account#createaccount" rel="nofollow">How do I create an account?</a></p>
          
          <p>Please be aware that you will not be able to save your draft on AO3 until you have filled in all required fields. The required fields include the rating tag, archive warning tag, fandom tag, the work title, and work language as well as the work text. Because of this, it is recommended that you draft your work on an external program first, such as Microsoft Word or Google Docs. This ensures you have a backup, as AO3 does not have an auto-save feature and deletes unpublished drafts after 30 days.</p>
          
          <p>To learn more about works on AO3, please refer to the <a href="https://archiveofourown.org/faq/posting-and-editing" rel="nofollow">Posting and Editing FAQ</a>.</p>
          

          <h3 id="newworknav">The Post New Work page</h3>
          
          <p>Navigate to the <a href="https://archiveofourown.org/works/new" rel="nofollow">Post New Work</a> page by going to the "Post" button on the header at the top of the website and selecting "New Work". On this page, you will see several sections:</p><ul>
          <li>Tags</li>
          <li>Preface</li>
          <li>Associations</li>
          <li>Privacy</li>
          <li>Work Text</li>
          <li>Post</li>
          </ul>
          
          <p>Fill out the fields in each section with the relevant information about your work. Required fields are denoted with red text and an asterisk. As previously stated, these required fields must all be filled out before you can save a draft of your work or post your work.</p>
          
          <p>If you already have a draft saved to your account, a button labeled "Restore From Last Unposted Draft?" will appear at the top of the page, which will redirect you to the Edit Work page for your last saved draft.</p>
          
          <p>Many fields have a blue question mark symbol displayed next to them. If you need additional help filling out a field, select the blue question mark to bring up a popup with more information.</p>
          
          
          <h3 id="newworktags">Tags</h3>
          
          <p>Tags are used to categorize works on AO3. For example, tagging your work for the character "Juliet Capulet", will allow any user searching AO3 for the tag "Juliet Capulet" to find your work. For more information on tags, refer to the <a href="https://archiveofourown.org/faq/tags#whatisatag" rel="nofollow"><span>Tags FAQ</span></a>.</p>
          
          <p>There are seven types of tags that works on AO3 can have.</p><ul>
          <li>Rating (required)</li>
          <li>Archive Warnings (required)</li>
          <li>Fandoms (required)</li>
          <li>Categories</li>
          <li>Relationships</li>
          <li>Characters</li>
          <li>Additional Tags</li>
          </ul>
          
          <p>Each tag can be up to 100 characters long. The maximum number of these types of tags that a single work can have is 75: fandom, relationship, character, and additional tags. Multiple tags should be separated by commas.</p><h4>Rating</h4>
          
          <p>A rating tag is required for all works. The following work ratings exist:</p><dl>
          <dt>Not Rated</dt>
          <dd>The author has chosen not to give this work a rating. The work may or may not have adult content.</dd>
          <dt>General Audiences</dt>
          <dd>This work is suitable for general audiences, including children. In film terms, this would be a G or PG rating.</dd>
          <dt>Teen and Up Audiences</dt>
          <dd>This work is suitable for teenagers and older audiences. There might be material inappropriate for children. In film terms, this would be a PG-13 rating.</dd>
          <dt>Mature</dt>
          <dd>This work is suitable for adults. It might contain some adult material or heavy themes inappropriate for younger audiences, but the content is generally not explicit. In film terms, this would be an R rating.</dd>
          <dt>Explicit</dt>
          <dd>This work is only suitable for adults. It contains extremely heavy themes or explicit content. In film terms, this would be an NC-17 rating.</dd>
          </dl>
          
          <p>Your work should be tagged for the highest rating reached. For example, a work has five chapters: four of them are appropriate for teen and up audiences, but the fifth has explicit content. Because one of the chapters has explicit content, the overall work should be tagged as "Explicit."</p><h4>Archive Warnings</h4>
          
          <p>At least one archive warning tag is required for all works. The archive warning tag(s) helps warn potential audiences about potentially triggering themes or content present in your work.</p><dl>
          <dt>Choose Not To Use Archive Warnings</dt>
          <dd>The author has chosen not to use any of AO3's warning tags. This does not necessarily mean that the work does not have content warnings; additional warnings might be listed in the additional tags or summary. Viewer discretion is advised.</dd>
          <dt>Graphic Depictions of Violence</dt>
          <dd>The work contains gore or other explicitly described depictions of violence.</dd>
          <dt>Major Character Death</dt>
          <dd>A major character in the work dies. What counts as a major character is left up to the creator of the work.</dd>
          <dt>No Archive Warnings Apply</dt>
          <dd>The work does not contain any of AO3's warning tags.</dd>
          <dt>Rape/Non-Con</dt>
          <dd>The work contains descriptions or depictions of rape or non-consensual sexual acts.</dd>
          <dt>Underage</dt>
          <dd>The work contains descriptions or depictions of sexual activity by characters under the age of eighteen.</dd>
          </dl>
          
          <p>Use your best judgement when it comes to archive warnings. When in doubt, it is good practice to over-warn rather than under-warn. If you feel that the available archive warnings are not sufficient enough for your work, then it is encouraged that you use the additional tags or summary to give other or more detailed warnings.</p>
          
          <p>For more information on warnings and what is allowed on AO3, see our policies in the <a href="https://archiveofourown.org/tos" rel="nofollow">Terms of Service</a> and <a href="https://archiveofourown.org/tos_faq" rel="nofollow">Terms of Service FAQ</a>.</p><h4>Fandoms</h4>
          
          <p>At least one fandom tag is required for all works. This fandom can be an existing form of media such as a movie, anime, or book. Alternatively, if your work was not derived from another form of media, then it is an original work and can be tagged with the "Original Work" tag, the "No Fandom" tag, or any other tag along those lines.</p>
          
          <p>If the fandom for your work already exists, then the "Fandoms" field will autocomplete if the fandom already exists. Otherwise, if your work is the first work in a fandom, then the tag for the fandom will need to be created. As such, the newly created fandom might not show up on the Fandoms page for a day or two. For more information on recently-created tags, visit the Tags FAQ.</p><h4>Categories</h4>
          
          <p>The category tags denote what type(s) of relationship(s) a work portrays. The "/" typically denotes a romantic or sexual relationship, although the exact definition varies from user to user. There are six category tags.</p><dl>
          <dt>F/F</dt>
          <dd>This work primarily features a female/female relationship.</dd>
          <dt>F/M</dt>
          <dd>This work primarily features a female/male relationship.</dd>
          <dt>Gen</dt>
          <dd>This work does not feature a romantic or sexual relationship, or if there is one, it is not the primary focus of the work.</dd>
          <dt>M/M</dt>
          <dd>This work primarily features a male/male relationship.</dd>
          <dt>Multi</dt>
          <dd>This work features more than one category, or it features a relationship with multiple partners.</dd>
          <dt>Other</dt>
          <dd>Other relationships.</dd>
          </dl>
          
          <p>The specifics of what these category tags mean are entirely up to the work's authors. You may select multiple tags or none at all.</p><h4>Relationships</h4>
          
          <p>The relationship tags denote what relationship(s) a work portrays. These relationships will be between at least two characters. In general, a "/" denotes a romantic or sexual relationship, while a "&amp;" is used to denote friendship or other non-romantic relationships.</p>
          
          <p>For example, a work portraying a romantic relationship between Hamlet and Ophelia would tag their relationship as "Hamlet/Ophelia". On the other hand, a work portraying a friendship between Hamlet and Ophelia would tag their relationship as "Hamlet &amp; Ophelia".</p><h4>Characters</h4>
          
          <p>The character tags denote what characters appear in your work. While it is generally encouraged to tag the major characters, it is up to the author whether to also tag more minor or supporting characters.</p><h4>Additional Tags</h4>
          
          <p>Any additional tags that do not fall under ratings, archive warnings, fandoms, categories, relationships, or characters can be included in this field. Some examples include "Eventual Romance", "Post-Canon", and "Alternate Universe - Coffee Shops &amp; Cafés". You can also use this field to warn for content not covered by the Archive Warnings, such as "Murder" or "Drug Use".</p>
          
          <p>Tags can be up to 100 characters in length.</p>
          
          <h3 id="newworkpreface">Preface</h3>
          
          <p>The preface of a work includes the title, creator credits, the summary of the work, and any creator notes before or after the work.</p><h4>Work Title</h4>
          
          <p>All works are required to have a title. The title of a work must be between 1 to 255 characters long.</p><h4>Creator/Pseud</h4>
          
          <p>If you have created a pseud, you can choose to publish your work under that pseud instead of your username. For more information on pseuds, visit the <a href="https://archiveofourown.org/faq/pseuds" rel="nofollow">Pseuds FAQ</a>.</p><h4>Add co-creators?</h4>
          
          <p>If you select this checkbox, you can add other AO3 users as <a href="https://archiveofourown.org/faq/glossary#codef" rel="nofollow">co-creators</a>. Be aware that adding another user as a co-creator will allow them to add to, edit, and delete your work. For more information on co-creators, see <a href="https://archiveofourown.org/faq/posting-and-editing#workcocreators" rel="nofollow">How do I add or remove co-creators?</a> and <a href="https://archiveofourown.org/faq/posting-and-editing#cocreatoraccess" rel="nofollow">What access does my co-creator have?</a> on the<a href="https://archiveofourown.org/faq/posting-and-editing" rel="nofollow"> Posting and Editing FAQ</a>.</p><h4>Summary</h4>
          
          <p>Along with the tags, the summary of a work helps users decide whether or not they want to view your work before visiting it. Your summary can be up to 1250 characters long and can contain basic HTML.</p><h4>Notes</h4>
          
          <p>You can include a note at the beginning of your work, the end of your work, or both by selecting the appropriate checkboxes. Unlike the summary, the notes are not shown to users before they visit your work.<br />
          The notes you enter in this section apply to the work as a whole. If you decide to add multiple chapters to a work, you can add beginning and end notes for each of those chapters as well. Therefore, if you decide to add an end note at this stage, then add more chapters to the work, that end note will appear at the end of the work, not at the end of the first chapter.</p>
          
          <h3 id="newworkassoc">Associations</h3>
          
          <p>The Associations section contains several options to link your work to other works or users.</p><h4>Post to Collections/Challenges</h4>
          
          <p>A work <a href="https://archiveofourown.org/faq/glossary#collectiondef" rel="nofollow">collection</a> is a group of works compiled together under one theme. For example, an author might use a collection to group all their works created for one fandom, or a collection could contain all the works created for a <a href="https://archiveofourown.org/faq/glossary#giftexchangedef" rel="nofollow">gift exchange</a> challenge event. For more information on collections and challenges, visit the <a href="https://archiveofourown.org/faq/collections" rel="nofollow">Collections FAQ</a>.</p><h4>Gifting</h4>
          
          <p>If you would like to, you can gift your work to another AO3 user. If you gift a fic to a user, that user will get a notification when your work is published. Additionally, the recipient's username will appear in the title line after the author credit.</p>
          
          <p>For example, if user William64 wants to gift his work titled "To Be or Not To Be" to user AnneofH, the title line of the work will read, "To Be or Not To Be by William64 for AnneofH". AnneofH will then be notified when To Be or Not To Be is published.</p>
          
          <p>You can gift your work to someone who is not a registered user of AO3. However, the autocomplete on this field will suggest matching registered usernames, if they exist, and might try to link your work to one of those users. For example, if you try to gift your work to your sibling named Alex, the autocomplete will link your work to the registered AO3 user Alex. This user will then be notified when you publish your work. Therefore, it is wise to differentiate the username in some way, such as using "Best sibling Alex" instead of Alex.</p>
          
          <p>For more information on gifting works, see How do I gift a work to someone? on the Posting and Editing FAQ.</p>
          
          <p>If at any later point in time, you as the gift-giver want to rescind a gift, you can edit your work and remove the recipient's name from this field. For instructions on how to edit your work, see How do I edit my work? on the Posting and Editing FAQ. For more information on rescinding gifted works, see How do I revoke a gift work I've given to someone?</p><h4>This work is a remix, a translation, a podfic, or was inspired by another work</h4>
          
          <p>Check this box if your work was inspired by another work. A link to the inspirational work and the creator of the inspirational work will appear in the Notes section before the body of your work. For example, if the work "Wonderful Woes" by user LemonLord was inspired by the work "Itchy Truths and Other Inconveniences" by user thayers12, the following text would appear at the top of the beginning notes for Wonderful Woes: "<u>Inspired by Itchy Truths and Other Inconveniences</u> by <u>thayers12</u>".</p>
          
          <p>Inspirational works can be from AO3 or published elsewhere. If the work is hosted on AO3, then the only field you'll need to fill out is the URL of the work. Otherwise, you'll also need to fill in the Title and Author of the inspirational work.</p>
          
          <p>If your work is a translation of the inspirational work, then check the "This is a translation" checkbox and use the Language menu to denote the language of the original inspirational work. For example, if the work "joy" by user LemonLord was translated from the work "幸福" by user Notovoid, the following text would appear at the top of the beginning notes for joy: "A translation of <u>幸福</u> by <u>Notovoid</u>".</p>
          
          <p>You will initially only be able to add one inspiration; to add another inspiration, save your work first, then Edit your work and add another entry in the same field. Saving your work is covered in the <a href="#newworkpost">Post section</a> later on in this document. For instructions on how to edit your work, see <a href="https://archiveofourown.org/faq/posting-and-editing#editwork" rel="nofollow">How do I edit my work?</a> on the <a href="https://archiveofourown.org/faq/posting-and-editing" rel="nofollow">Posting and Editing FAQ</a>.</p>
          
          <p>If you list a creator's work as inspiration for your work, the creator of the inspiration will be able to see your work in their "Related Works." If they approve of your work, the creator can choose to link your inspired work on their original work as well.</p><h4>This work is part of a series</h4>
          
          <p>Check this box if your work is part of a series. A work series is a set of related works, each of them complete on its own. Think of each work as its own book, and the work series as a series of books. If you want to add your work to a series, you can either choose an existing series or create a new one using the "Or create and use a new one:" field.</p>
          
          <p>For more information on series, visit the <a href="https://archiveofourown.org/faq/series" rel="nofollow">Series FAQ</a>.</p><h4>This work has multiple chapters</h4>
          
          <p>Check this box if your work has multiple chapters. If each work is a book, then work chapters function in a similar way as book chapters.</p>
          
          <p>If you know how many chapters your work will have, replace the "?" in "Chapter 1 of ?" with the expected number of chapters. If you don't know, then leave the "?" as is.</p>
          
          <p>You can also give each of your chapters a name using the "Chapter Title:" field. If you don't name your chapters, then they will simply be named "Chapter 1", "Chapter 2", and so on. However, the chapter name for the first chapter won't show up until there are at least two chapters.</p><h4>Set a different publication date</h4>
          
          <p>Check this box if you want to set the publication date of your work to a date different from the current date. This is typically a date in the past, also known as backdating. For example, if you are reuploading a work you originally published on a different website, you might backdate the work to the original publishing date.</p>
          
          <p>Be aware that changing the publication date of your work will affect where your work appears on your dashboard, the works page, and anywhere else where works are sorted in chronological order; if you backdate your Naruto fanwork to 1999, it will not appear on the first page of the "Naruto" fandom tag when sorting by Date Updated.</p>
          
          <p>Changing the publication date will not affect your work appearing in RSS feeds as a newly posted work.</p><h4>Language</h4>
          
          <p>The Language field is required. Select the language your work text was created in. If your language is not in the menu, then please contact Support through the <a href="https://archiveofourown.org/support" rel="nofollow">Support and Feedback form</a> to let us know.</p><h4>Select Work Skin</h4>
          
          <p>If you would like to apply a work skin to your work, select one from the menu list. Work skins can be used to alter the appearance of a work using CSS. These work skins will affect how your work appears to all users. For example, work skins can be used to change the font or color of the text in your work. To learn more about using work skins, visit the <a href="https://archiveofourown.org/faq/skins-and-archive-interface" rel="nofollow">Skins and Archive Interface FAQ</a> or the <a href="https://archiveofourown.org/admin_posts/119" rel="nofollow"><span>Tutorial: Styling Works</span></a>.</p>
          
          
          <h3 id="newworkpriv">Privacy</h3>
          
          <p>The privacy options limit who can interact with your works.</p><h4>Only show your work to registered users</h4>
          
          <p>Checking this box means that only users who are signed in to AO3 will be able to access your work. Additionally, your work will not show up on Google and other search engines.</p><h4>Enable comment moderation</h4>
          
          <p>Checking this box means that you will have to approve any user comments before they appear publicly on your work.</p><h4>Who can comment on this work</h4>
          
          <p>The "Who can comment on this work" options dictate which users can leave comments on your work.</p><dl>
          <dt>Registered users and guests can comment</dt>
          <dd>Anyone can comment on your work unless you block their account.</dd>
          <dt>Only registered users can comment</dt>
          <dd>Logged in users can comment on your work unless you block their account.</dd>
          <dt>No one can comment</dt>
          <dd>The comment box will be disabled on your work and no new comments can be made.</dd>
          </dl>
          
          <p>Changing the "Who can comment on this work" setting will not affect existing comments. For example, if you previously allowed comments on a work but decide to change the setting to "No one can comment", then the already existing comments will remain.

          <h3 id="newworktext">Work Text</h3>
          
          <p>AO3 creators have the option of entering their work text in either Rich Text format or HTML format.</p><h4>Rich Text Editor</h4>
          
          <p>If you have drafted your work in a word processor such as Microsoft Word or Google Docs, then we recommend you use the Rich Text format in order to preserve formatting (such as italicization, bolding, links, lists, and headers).</p>
          
          <p>When you paste text into AO3's Rich Text editor, the results might vary based on your device, browser, and what text editor you originally copied your text from. Use the following tips to make the most out of AO3's rich text editor.</p><ul>
          <li><strong>Type Enter only once at the end of each paragraph</strong> to separate paragraphs in your work. Inputting Enter twice will result in a blank paragraph, which AO3's automatic formatting will interpret by inserting an additional space between text paragraphs.</li>
          <li><strong>Use your word processor's preset styles</strong> if you want to include headings, block quotations, or code in your work. AO3's rich text editor will not take into account any font or font size changes otherwise.</li>
          <li><strong>Double-check your formatting before publishing.</strong> Underlining, strikethroughs, and text alignment are commonly achieved in text editors using CSS. As AO3 does not allow inline CSS, these text styles are commonly lost when pasting.</li>
          <ul>
          <li>In some cases, your formatting might appear to be preserved when pasting into the rich text editor, but improper formatting might be removed by our HTML sanitizer upon selecting the Preview or Post buttons.</li>
          <li>This holds especially true if you are pasting in from Google Drive, which formats much of their styles (such as bolding, italicizing, and text alignment) entirely using CSS. Only pure HTML items such as tables, links, and lists will retain their formatting when pasting between Google Drive and AO3's Rich Text editor.</li>
          </ul></ul>
          
          <p>There is a common bug where the Rich Text editor will not register the text pasted in, indicating that you still have 500000 characters left. If this happens, switch from the Rich Text editor to the HMTL editor, then switch back.</p><h4>HTML Editor</h4>
          
          <p>If you drafted your work using HTML, then you can paste your work into the HTML editor. Any HTML code entered into AO3 is run through our parsers to ensure it is safe for our website and accessible for our users.</p>
          
          <p>AO3 does not allow all HTML for user-created works. Users are limited to the following HTML tags:<br />
          <samp>a, abbr, acronym, address, b, big, blockquote, br, caption, center, cite, code, col, colgroup, dd, del, dfn, div, dl, dt, em, h1, h2, h3, h4, h5, h6, hr, i, img, ins, kbd, li, ol, p, pre, q, s, samp, small, span, strike, strong, sub, sup, table, tbody, td, tfoot, th, thead, tr, tt, u, ul, var. </samp></p>
          
          <p>Attempting to use an HTML tag not on this list will result in AO3's HTML sanitizer striping that markup from your work.</p>
          
          <p>For more information about using HTML on AO3, visit <a href="https://archiveofourown.org/faq/formatting-content-on-ao3-with-html" rel="nofollow">Formatting content on AO3 with HTML</a> and <a href="https://archiveofourown.org/help/html-help.html" rel="nofollow">HTML on the Archive</a>.</p>
          
          
          <h3 id="newworkpost">Post</h3>
          
          <p>The Post New Work Page has three buttons in the Post section: Preview, Post, and Cancel.<br />
          Select the "Preview" button if you would like to preview your work before publishing. Select the "Post" button to publish your work immediately. Select "Cancel" to navigate back to your dashboard and delete your unsaved draft.</p>
          
          <p>If you decide to preview your work before publishing, you will be taken to the preview page. At the bottom of this page, you will see four buttons: Post, Save As Draft, Edit, and Cancel.</p><dl>
          <dt>Post</dt>
          <dd>Publish your work now.</dd>
          <dt>Save As Draft</dt>
          <dd>Save your work as an unpublished draft, which you can edit and publish later. Drafts will be saved on AO3 for 30 days, after which it will be automatically deleted. Drafts can only be seen by the creator and any co-creators.</dd>
          <dt>Edit</dt>
          <dd>This option takes you back to the Edit Work page. The Edit Work page is almost identical to the Post New Work page except that a Save As Draft button is added to the Post section at the bottom of the page.</dd>
          <dt>Cancel</dt>
          <dd>Close your draft without saving. If you select the Cancel button without saving, you will lose all work on the page and will not be able to recover it.</dd>
          </dl>
          
          <p>Whether you preview before publishing or immediately publish your work, it might take a few minutes for your work to show up in the tags. However, once your work is published, anyone with the link to your work will be able to view, bookmark, and comment on it. You can still edit your work any time after your work is posted; for instructions on how to do this, see <a href="https://archiveofourown.org/faq/posting-and-editing#editwork" rel="nofollow">How do I edit my work?</a> on the <a href="https://archiveofourown.org/faq/posting-and-editing" rel="nofollow">Posting and Editing FAQ</a>.</p>
