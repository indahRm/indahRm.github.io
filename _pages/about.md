Hi! I'm Indah. I graduated from Texas A&M University in 2021 with a Bacherlor's degree in Industrial Engineering (that's the type of engineering that focuses on processes and efficiency). Although I adore engineering, I leared about technical writing in my senior year, and I decided I wanted to pursue a writing career instead!

I really love writing, and I do a lot of it outside of work. I've written fiction since high school, and recently I've been combining writing and graphic design (another passion of mine!) to make [zines](https://tamu.libguides.com/ZineMaking), which are basically DIY/homemade books. You can see an example of a zine, "Copy That! A Guide to Printing Zines", in my [Sample Works](/portfolio).
