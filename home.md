This brochure was made for the nonprofit volunteer organization Katy Responds, which helps rebuild homes after natural disasters. I was asked to make something that could be given out to promote the organization to potential volunteers, donors, and clients: three very different audiences.

My instructions for the aesthetic designs were to make the brochure "warm, comforting, and inviting." I was in charge of both the copy and design.
