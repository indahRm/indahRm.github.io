A zine explaining how to best format digitally-made zines so they are optimized for printing. Feel free to print! You'll find an explaination on how to do so on page 9.

There are a lot of zines about zines out there, of which most are about how to make zines traditionally. However, while I do enjoy hands-on crafting, I tend to find myself drawing on my computer more often than not. When I was working on a personal zine project a while back, I noticed that there weren't many guides on how to optimize your zines for printing. At my job at Cram Crew, I was put in charge with making new training booklets and had to figure out how to format and print those by myself, which turned out to be a highly transferrable skill when it came to printing zines. I decided to combine my knowledge gained from that experience and my love for zine-making into this guide!
