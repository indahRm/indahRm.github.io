Guide to installing and troubleshooting the uBlock Origins browser extension to block YouTube ads. I made this guide to help YouTube users troubleshoot their adblock once YouTube started implementing anti-adblock.

I used to not mind YouTube ads, but ever since they hit 15 seconds, they've become the bane of my existence. However, I was able to largely ignore them and maintain my online privacy with the help of the uBlock Origins adblocker. But recently, YouTube's been trying to fight back against adblockers. This is a violation of one of the World Wide Web Consortium's Ethical Web Principles, "[2.12](https://www.w3.org/TR/ethical-web-principles/#render) People should be able to render web content as they want." With how vast the internet is and how much time people spend online, it is very important to me that users are able to equip themselves with safety percautions and quality-of-life features such as adblockers.
